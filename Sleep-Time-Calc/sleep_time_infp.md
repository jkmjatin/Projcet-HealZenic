The optimal sleep time for an individual varies by age and other factors. Based on the **National Sleep Foundation** and other sleep research, the recommended sleep duration for various age groups is as follows:

- **Newborns (0-3 months):** 14-17 hours
- **Infants (4-11 months):** 12-15 hours
- **Toddlers (1-2 years):** 11-14 hours
- **Preschoolers (3-5 years):** 10-13 hours
- **School-age children (6-13 years):** 9-11 hours
- **Teenagers (14-17 years):** 8-10 hours
- **Young adults (18-25 years):** 7-9 hours
- **Adults (26-64 years):** 7-9 hours
- **Older adults (65+ years):** 7-8 hours

Below is a Python program that analyzes and provides recommendations based on the age and reported sleep duration.

### **How It Works**:
1. **`get_recommended_sleep_time(age)`**:
   - This function returns the recommended sleep range (min, max) based on the userâ€™s age.
   - The recommended sleep times are based on research from sources like the **National Sleep Foundation**.

2. **`analyze_sleep(age, sleep_hours)`**:
   - Compares the reported sleep hours to the recommended sleep range for the given age.
   - Provides feedback if the user is sleeping too little or too much and encourages them to aim for the optimal sleep duration.

3. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter their age and the number of hours they sleep.
   - The program then outputs a recommendation based on the provided information.

---

### **How to Run**:
1. Save the code as `sleep_time_analysis.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python sleep_time_analysis.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to input your age and sleep hours.

### **Sleep Time Recommendations Based on Age**:
- **0-3 months**: 14-17 hours
- **4-11 months**: 12-15 hours
- **1-2 years**: 11-14 hours
- **3-5 years**: 10-13 hours
- **6-13 years**: 9-11 hours
- **14-17 years**: 8-10 hours
- **18-25 years**: 7-9 hours
- **26-64 years**: 7-9 hours
- **65+ years**: 7-8 hours

This program helps users determine if they are getting the right amount of sleep according to scientific standards and provides recommendations to improve their sleep quality! ðŸ˜´
