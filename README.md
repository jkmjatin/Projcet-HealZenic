### **Project HealZenic: Repository Description**  

**Project HealZenic** is a health-focused initiative designed to simplify and personalize health assessments for everyday users. This repository serves as the core of HealZenic, housing algorithms that calculate various health parameters, predict initial health statuses, and provide actionable recommendations based on basic user data such as age, weight, height, and dietary preferences.

### **Repository Features**  
- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculation**: Algorithms to estimate the calories needed for essential bodily functions.  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI) Evaluation**: Tools to categorize users' weight health based on their height and weight.  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Frameworks to offer dietary and activity suggestions tailored to individual needs.  
- **Age Reversal Science Exploration**: Experimental algorithms aimed at predicting biological age and integrating emerging health science.

### **About HealZenic**  
HealZenic was initiated by three Computer Science & Engineering students from ABSS Institute of Technology, Meerut. The project's mission is to make health assessments accessible, accurate, and secure without relying on advanced hardware like smartwatches.  

This repository is the heart of HealZenic's scientific backbone, combining open research, computational models, and scalable algorithms to help users better understand and improve their health.  

**Contributions**: Open for collaboration! We welcome contributions to refine existing algorithms or introduce new ways to calculate health parameters.  

**Security Note**: All algorithms prioritize user privacy and do not rely on or store sensitive user data.
