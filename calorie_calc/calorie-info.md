**Calorie burning (energy expenditure)** refers to the energy your body uses for essential functions and physical activity. Calculating the required calorie burn is crucial for managing weight (losing, maintaining, or gaining). Here's how it works:

---

### **Steps to Calculate Calorie Burn and Requirements:**

#### **1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):**
This is the number of calories your body needs at rest to perform basic functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production.  
- **Men (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation):**
  \[
  BMR = 10 * Weight (kg) + 6.25 * Height (cm) - 5 * Age (years) + 5
  \]
- **Women:**
  \[
  BMR = 10 * Weight (kg) + 6.25 * Height (cm) - 5 * Age (years) - 161
  \]

#### **2. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):**
TDEE includes calories burned through daily activities and exercise. Multiply BMR by an activity factor:
- **Sedentary (little/no exercise):** \(TDEE = BMR * 1.2)
- **Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1–3 days/week):** ( TDEE = BMR * 1.375 )
- **Moderately active (moderate exercise 3–5 days/week):** ( TDEE = BMR * 1.55 )
- **Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week):** ( TDEE = BMR * 1.725 )
- **Extra active (very hard exercise/physical job):** ( TDEE = BMR * 1.9 )

#### **3. Calorie Requirement Based on Goal:**
- **Weight Maintenance:** Consume calories equal to TDEE.
- **Weight Loss:** Create a calorie deficit:
  - Safe rate: ( TDEE - 500 , calories/day ) (approx. 0.5 kg weight loss per week).
- **Weight Gain:** Create a calorie surplus:
  - ( TDEE + 500 , calories/day ) (approx. 0.5 kg weight gain per week).

### **Example Calculation:**
- **Person's Data:**
  - Weight: 70 kg
  - Height: 175 cm
  - Age: 30 years
  - Activity level: Moderately active

- **Step 1: Calculate BMR (Men's Formula):**
  \[
  BMR = 10 * 70 + 6.25 * 175 - 5 * 30 + 5 = 1667.5 , calories/day
  \]

- **Step 2: Calculate TDEE:**
  \[
  TDEE = 1667.5 * 1.55 = 2584.63 , calories/day
  \]

- **Step 3: Adjust Based on Goal:**
  - To lose weight: ( 2584.63 - 500 = 2084.63 , calories/day)
  - To gain weight: ( 2584.63 + 500 = 3084.63 , calories/day)

### **Calories Burned Through Activity:**
You can estimate calories burned during specific activities using METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task).  
\[
Calories burned = MET * Weight (kg) * Duration (hours)
\]
- Example: A 70 kg person jogging (MET 7) for 30 minutes:
  \[
  \text{Calories burned} = 7 * 70 * 0.5 = 245 , calories
  \]

### **Key Notes:**
- Consistency in diet and activity is crucial.
- Avoid extreme deficits or surpluses for sustainable results.
- Pair calorie tracking with balanced nutrition and hydration for overall health.
