**Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR)** is a simple measure used to assess body fat distribution and evaluate the risk of obesity-related health problems. It compares the circumference of the waist to the person's height.

### **Formula:**
\[
WHtR = Waist Circumference (cm) / Height (cm)
\]

- **Waist circumference:** Measured at the narrowest part of the torso (usually just above the navel) without compressing the skin.
- **Height:** Measured in centimeters (or inches, but ensure units are consistent).

### **Standard Values and Risk Categories:**
The WHtR values are interpreted as follows:

| **WHtR Range** | **Risk Category**               |  
|-----------------|---------------------------------|  
| Below 0.40      | Underweight (Possible health risks) |  
| 0.40–0.49       | Healthy weight (Low health risk)   |  
| 0.50–0.59       | Overweight (Moderate health risk)  |  
| 0.60 and above  | Obese (High health risk)          |

### **Why WHtR is Important:**
- **Better Indicator of Fat Distribution:** Unlike BMI, WHtR takes into account abdominal fat, which is more closely linked to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
- **Universal Application:** It works well across different genders, ethnic groups, and age ranges.

---

### **Practical Example:**
- **Waist Circumference:** 80 cm  
- **Height:** 170 cm  
\[
  WHtR = 80/170 = 0.47
\]
- **Interpretation:** A WHtR of 0.47 falls in the healthy weight range, indicating low health risk.

### **Recommendations for WHtR Maintenance:**
- Maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise to reduce waist circumference if needed.
- Focus on core-strengthening activities to reduce abdominal fat.
- Monitor WHtR periodically as part of routine health assessments.
