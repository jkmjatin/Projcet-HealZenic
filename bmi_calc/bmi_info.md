**BMI (Body Mass Index)** is a measure used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight relative to their height. It is widely used as a simple screening tool for categorizing weight status.

### **How BMI is Calculated:**
The formula for BMI is:  
BMI= Weight (kg)/Height (m)^2

### **Parameters of BMI:**
BMI is interpreted using the following categories set by the **World Health Organization (WHO):**  

| **BMI Range (kg/m²)** | **Category**                     |  
|------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| Below 18.5             | Underweight                    |  
| 18.5–24.9              | Normal weight                  |  
| 25–29.9                | Overweight                     |  
| 30–34.9                | Obesity Class I (Mild)         |  
| 35–39.9                | Obesity Class II (Moderate)    |  
| 40 and above           | Obesity Class III (Severe)     |

### **Key Parameters in BMI:**
1. **Weight:** Measured in kilograms (kg) or pounds (lbs).  
2. **Height:** Measured in meters (m) or inches (in).  
3. **Age and Gender:** While BMI is calculated the same way regardless of age or gender, interpretations might vary. For example, BMI doesn't account for differences in muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution.

### **Uses and Limitations of BMI:**
- **Uses:**  
  - Quick screening tool for weight-related health risks.  
  - Helps identify potential undernutrition or overweight issues.  

- **Limitations:**  
  - Does not distinguish between fat and muscle mass.  
  - May misclassify athletes or muscular individuals as overweight.  
  - Does not account for fat distribution (e.g., visceral vs. subcutaneous fat).  

For a more comprehensive health assessment, BMI should be used alongside other measures like waist circumference, body fat percentage, and overall lifestyle analysis.
