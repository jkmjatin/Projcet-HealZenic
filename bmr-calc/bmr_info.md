**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic life-sustaining functions (e.g., breathing, circulating blood) while at rest. The most common formulas to calculate BMR are the **Harris-Benedict Equation** and the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**.

### **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Preferred)**
This is considered more accurate for modern lifestyles.

**For Men:**
\[
BMR = 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) - 5 * age (years) + 5
\]

**For Women:**
\[
BMR = 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) - 5 * age (years) - 161
\]
